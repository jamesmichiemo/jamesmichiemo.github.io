A few months ago, I learned about a new mobile service called [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/omeichim). Back then I was looking around for a reasonable unlimited phone plan that didn't involve contracts. At the time, my phone carrier was [Red Pocket Mobile](http://goredpocket.com), which was great but their mobile web data plan costed more and was limited to only 2gigs of data and I wasn't going to sign a contract with another mobile service to be charged for more data usage.

Personally, I can't stand contract service agreements. If I'm unhappy with anyone's service, I should be able to decide not to continue doing business with them. Why should I guarantee my money every month to a phone service that's questionable? I've always felt more comfortable using a prepaid plan. I like the freedom of having other options available.

But you know what? Companies probably make you sign contracts so you won't run off to new companies like [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/omeichim). I lucked out finding a great service like Solavei. I found {" an affordable unlimited mobile service plan without any contract agreements "} and so far I'm really happy with it.

I didn't really trust them at first since they're a completely new company, but my family in Dallas who I love and trust assured me that Solavei was something that I would want to be a part of. 

After hours of research, I went ahead and ditched my old plan and ordered my unlimited phone plan with [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/omeichim). It's been 3 months already and I'm 100% satisfied with their revolutionary phone service.

My prepaid plan came up to $58.34 a month including tax and that's without participating in their [referral program](http://www.solavei.com/what-is-solavei). If you recruit enough members to Solavei, eventually, you won't even have a monthly bill to pay. Solavei actually pays its members for sharing their services with other people.

Switching carriers was a no brainer for me. There were no activation fees involved other than the 9 dollar SIM card I had to ship to myself. Once I got my SIM card in the mail, I popped it into my iPhone and I was set. I've never been happier with my phone.

It feels awesome to be able to blog about this new service as an early adopter. I have a feeling that Solavei is only going to get bigger. Be sure to check out Solavie's video down below to learn more.
