Inspired by a tip from [Oscar Cortez](http://www.drastudio.com), one of my instructors at [Full Sail University](http://www.fullsail.edu), I decided to host my [Octopress](http://octopress.org) locally on [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com). I found this setup to be a great idea for editing on mobile devices, because with our repo connected to Dropbox, we are able to make changes to Octopress wherever Dropbox access is available.

I'm actually typing this blog post with a text editor on my iPhone. The app that I'm using is called [Nocs](http://www.wisp.com/nocs/). It's a text editor that integrates well with both Dropbox and the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format that Octopress uses to publish with.

In the Nocs app, I'm able to navigate and edit the Octopress directory through Dropbox with ease.

The Dropbox/Nocs combo allows me to write anywhere with my iPhone. Then once my post is ready to go, all I need to do is push my Octopress repo up in [Terminal]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)") using 

<pre><code>$ rake generate</code></pre>

and

<pre><code>$ rake deploy</code></pre>

Easy.

Both apps are available for free at the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8).
