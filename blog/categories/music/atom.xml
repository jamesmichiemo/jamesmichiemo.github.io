    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Web browsers are increasingly becoming more advanced and have progressed beyond simply displaying hypertext and images. The 3D technology that we&rsquo;ve been enjoying through video games and movies has recently become available through today&rsquo;s modern browsers. For those who aren&rsquo;t familiar, WebGL is the latest HTML5 trend that uses JavaScript to render interactive three-dimensional graphics.</p>

<p>WebGL is still an experiment but that&rsquo;s what I love about it. I love everything that&rsquo;s experimental, especially experimental music. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the Fuck Buttons and I was totally blown away by their latest album, &ldquo;Slow Focus&rdquo;. As an experiment, I decided to try out WebGL to make a 3D version of the cover art for their single, &ldquo;The Red Wing&rdquo;, which can be seen at the link below.</p>

<p>What I ended up creating was really basic compared to other WebGL experiments found on the internet, but I&rsquo;m fine with that because I learned something new along the way with something that I&rsquo;m passionate about. I&rsquo;ll never get tired of obsessing over the ways that technology pushes art and vice versa. As technology moves forward, we&rsquo;ll find even more ways to share art with one another. I&rsquo;m really excited to see what the future holds for interactive media.</p>
