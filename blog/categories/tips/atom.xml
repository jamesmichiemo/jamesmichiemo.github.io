    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Macbook is dead. I knew this would happen one day, especially at an important time, like now, when I&rsquo;m preparing for an internship interview for Linkedin. It&rsquo;s entirely my fault. I shouldn&rsquo;t have been drinking and typing. It was a sad moment to watch the water from my cup flow right through my keyboard buttons, but it wasn&rsquo;t as painful as it could have been.</p>

<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m looking into getting my Macbook replaced but in the meantime I have work to do. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve got another machine at home running Ubuntu. Right before my disaster, I was able to upload my dotfile configurations to Github, so I&rsquo;m fortunate enough to be able to transfer my previous development environment over to my Ubuntu laptop. It&rsquo;s an old and clunky laptop compared to my Macbook but it works almost completely the same as far as Unix tools.</p>

<p>I also dodged a bullet by keeping all my current projects on Dropbox. I&rsquo;d have to say that Dropbox probably uses up the most processing power out of all the applications on my machine right now but it&rsquo;s worth it having all your important documents synced just in case anything happens. Backing up files is never a bad idea.</p>

<p>I should be more upset about my situation but everything happens for a reason. I&rsquo;ll just remember this as a learning experience and a lesson in how you can never be too prepared for when disaster strikes.</p>

<p>Back up everything.</p>
