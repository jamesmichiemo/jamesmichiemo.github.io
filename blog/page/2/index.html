			How to Use Octopress: Deployment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In our last <a href="http://jamesmichiemo.github.com/blog/2013/02/16/installing-octopress/">&ldquo;How to Use Octopress&rdquo;</a> blog post, we went over how to setup our blog, but that was only the first step. The next step would be to make our Octopress available through hosting. Right now, the Octopress we installed is only setup locally. Only users with access to your computer are able to view the blog, but once we have our Octopress available through hosting, anyone with internet access will be able to find it.</p>

<p>For hosting my own blog, I chose to use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. There were several other options but I felt better having my blog linked to the same place I keep my other projects on <a href="https://github.com/jamesmichiemo">my Github account</a>. It made sense considering that most of what I&rsquo;ll be writing about on my blog will revolve around these repositories. As I update my repos, I&rsquo;ll be updating my blog.</p>

<p><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/octocat1.png" alt="Octocat" /></p>

<h2>Using Github Pages</h2>

<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> is a free public hosting service that allows users more freedom in workflow options with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and other tools for web such as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It&rsquo;s most likely the best choice for our blog. I assume Octopress was created with Github in mind, considering the workflow format and the similarity between mascots.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty documentation for assisting in deploying to Github Pages on the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">official docs page</a>. I recommend following the simple instructions offered there, but I&rsquo;ll still walkthrough and share my experience deploying my Octopress.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Github Repository</h3>

<p>For a Github Page, we will need a Github account. <a href="https://github.com/users">Make one</a> if you don&rsquo;t have a Github account already.</p>

<p>With your Github account, <a href="https://github.com/new">create a new repository</a> and name the repo <code>username.github.com</code></p>

<p><code><a href="http://username.github.com">http://username.github.com</a></code> will be the url for the Octopress.</p>

<h3>Configuring Github Pages</h3>

<p>The next step in our deployment is to use <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> to configure github pages. Octopress has a built-in task for setting up everything so all that&rsquo;s needed is the following command to be entered into Terminal while inside the Octopress directory.</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages</code></pre>


<p>A prompt will appear to enter the repo url. Entering the url made in the previous step will link your Octopress to the new Github repo.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s complete, we are now able to use rake to commit and push whatever changes that are made to the Octopress directory by entering:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate</code>
<code>rake deploy</code></pre>


<p>With this our Octopress is now published!</p>

<p>Check the url to see if it&rsquo;s up. If you can&rsquo;t find your blog at the url, carefully repeat the steps until it works.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve only covered the beginning stages, but at least now we have a visible working blog on the web. Next, we&rsquo;ll take a look into posting and making configurations with Octopress.</p>

			StartupBus 2013</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is gonna be so awesome! Yesterday, I got the news that I&rsquo;ve been accepted to join the <a href="http://startupbus.com/">StartupBus</a> crew for 2013. Once again, I&rsquo;ll be making my pilgrimage over to Austin for <a href="http://sxsw.com/">SxSW</a>. This&rsquo;ll be my 4th trip to the conference, but this time I&rsquo;ll be joining a team to create a startup on our way there.</p>

<p><img src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2013-02-19/AdxnhkBpnliGDiEJotxhumEodpcFovhuJbaAmwklArkmCzkHyAbCIqoxzDcm/The_Bus.jpg.scaled500.jpg" alt="StartupBus" /></p>

<p>The StartupBus is basically an annual event where teams of strangers on a bus travel together to conceive, build and launch startups. Each team only has 72 hours to create a startup that&rsquo;s ready to present to potential investors at the end of the trip.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m really psyched to be a part of this and I&rsquo;m very thankful for this opportunity to collaborate with others to do great things.</p>

			Dev Bootcamp: Post-Interview</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>The Decision</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing, but the folks at Dev Bootcamp decided that I was not a good fit for the program. I&rsquo;m not completely surprised considering what I had learned of their expectations after the 9 weeks of training.</p>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qp-iEkmZat4/T86GsKnKOmI/AAAAAAAAASE/zynlHGxrjTk/s1600/rejected.gif" alt="Rejected" /></p>

<p>A good chunk of my interview with Karim Bishay was spent discussing what was to be expected after Dev Bootcamp. After thorough questioning, it became clear to me that Dev Bootcamp was more than a 9 week commitment. Boots are expected to hit the ground running into their careers.</p>

<p>My plans were a bit different, since my goals at Dev Bootcamp had more to do with supplementing the education and training that I already had in place for myself. Moving and working in San Francisco would have been a dream come true but I wasn&rsquo;t willing to make that decision right now as a commited student at Full Sail University.</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to speculate the reasons for why things happen, but I don&rsquo;t want to fall into the trap of dwelling on my failed interview. Right now, the best thing for me to do is to focus on improving my interviewing skills. Apparently, I don&rsquo;t interview well, so I should be working on that right away. To prepare for future interviews, I&rsquo;ll be focusing on practicing the main thing I believe that&rsquo;s important to master for scoring developer positions, solving puzzles.</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p>As a developer, you&rsquo;ll be expected to solve several problems in your career. By sharing the way you solve problems through interview puzzles, employers are better able to gauge your critical thinking ablities. It isn&rsquo;t enough that you get the right answer. What matters is your ability to communicate what you&rsquo;re doing to solve the problem and why you&rsquo;re doing it. The only way to get better at this is to practice.</p>

<p><img src="http://projecteuler.net/images/euler_portrait.png" alt="A Portrait of Euler" /></p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a great site for sharpening your problem solving skills. Taking the time to work through these puzzles will help tremendously for developer interviews. I&rsquo;ve already created an account for myself, so by the time I get to my next interview, I&rsquo;ll be ready for anything.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ve Learned</h2>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned is that this isn&rsquo;t going to be an easy career field to get into. It&rsquo;s going to take a lot of work. I&rsquo;m going to have to rely on dedication and perserverance to get what I want out of this.  There&rsquo;ll be plenty of fail along the way, but it&rsquo;s okay because there&rsquo;s more to learn from our failures than from our small successes along the way.</p>

			The Cathode App for Mac</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For those of you who like to get your hands dirty in the shell, I want to show you a really cool Mac app that&rsquo;s made by <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/">Secret Geometry</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.secretgeometry.com/media/screenshot13.jpg" alt="Cathode screens" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/apps/cathode/">Cathode</a> app is an emulator that runs Terminal in a retro style that closely resembles cathode monitors from the past. It&rsquo;s a fun Terminal alternative for anyone who likes to apply unique themes to their favorite apps. All of the themes that come with Cathode are incredibly detailed and take their authentic looking styles from several different computer eras.</p>

<p>The older crowd will definitely appreciate the app for all the flicker and noise effects that give a nostalgic feel to the Terminal experience. For others, it&rsquo;s a nice to have novelty app that looks like an old school tool for hacking.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a wonderful app that&rsquo;s stable, reliable, and fun to use. I like to have it open at all times in case I need to use the command line for anything.</p>

<p>Cathode is free to evaluate but it&rsquo;s $9.99 for the full version. Go ahead and give it a try.</p>

			Dev Bootcamp: The Interview</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was my first Skype interview ever. I was punctual and armed with a pen, pad and a positive attitude. I had an idea of what to expect from reading several other blogs from other Dev Bootcamp candidates, but somehow I was still caught off guard.</p>

<p>Once the Skype tone turned on, I choked. My blank mind struggled to find words to express simple phrases like &ldquo;Hi&rdquo; and &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; to maintain a decent conversation flow.</p>

<p>The interview had already begun, and I was greeted by Karim Bishay. After introducing myself, we shot a few questions back and forth about the Dev Bootcamp program.</p>

<p>Soon after we got settled in, he finally threw down the gauntlet and gave me a puzzle to walk him through. I was already somewhat familiar with the puzzle but I didn&rsquo;t say anything because I still had no idea what the answer was even after several minutes passing. It was challenging only because my brain moves so much faster than my ability to explain things. Maintaining both focus and communication was the real challenge.</p>

<p>After solving the puzzle, Karim asked the big question. The question was &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; That was the one question I really wanted to answer. I simply gave him my own personal definition of success and explained how my actions aligned with my goals.</p>

<p>When I finished my explanation, he looked way more satisfied with my &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; answer than with my solution to the puzzle.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel really good about my prospects. It was a great experience to get a feel for the big interviews that we have to conquer for a respectable salary.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next one.</p>

			Creating Snippets</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Do you find yourself repeatedly looking up the same code and copy/pasting from project to project?</p>

<p>Stop torturing yourself and get a text editor that uses snippets.</p>

<p>Code snippets are a great way to increase your workflow productivity, and in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, making use of them is easy and simple. I highly recommend snippets to anyone who wants to become a faster coder. I should warn you though, hacks won&rsquo;t instantly make you a &ldquo;better&rdquo; coder. True skills come with practice.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>So? Where do we begin?</p>

<p>First, we need a text editor worth bragging about. I love Sublime Text. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Download it.</a> It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll be using in this post to show how snippets work. There are other text editors like <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> that work great with snippets, but I prefer Sublime Text.</p>

<p><img src="http://c758482.r82.cf2.rackcdn.com/sublime_text_icon_2181.png" alt="Sublime Text" /></p>

<p>In Sublime Text, a snippet is a block of code that&rsquo;s inserted into your working document when triggered. An example would be typing in ‘html’ and hitting the Tab key afterwards to trigger the following output below within an html document.(FYI:this default snippet won&rsquo;t work in any other document format)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ok, not very exciting, but what if I told you that you can create a snippet anyway you want, using ANY kind of text to trigger ANY size block of code of your choosing. Oh and you can place any number of cursors anywhere within that block to type multiple code values at the same time.</p>

<p>Yea I know.</p>

<p>Sublime Text. Download. Install. Open.</p>

<h2>New Game</h2>

<p>Now that we have Sublime Text up and running, we&rsquo;re going to go ahead and open up the snippet template.</p>

<p>In your Sublime Text menu, search within the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; dropdown and select &ldquo;New Snippet&hellip;&rdquo;. You should be presented with a template that looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;snippet&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;content&gt;</span><span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">Hello, ${1:this} is a ${2:snippet}.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">]]&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/content&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Optional: Set a tabTrigger to define how to trigger the snippet --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c">&lt;!-- &lt;tabTrigger&gt;hello&lt;/tabTrigger&gt; --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c">&lt;!-- Optional: Set a scope to limit where the snippet will trigger --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c">&lt;!-- &lt;scope&gt;source.python&lt;/scope&gt; --&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/snippet&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Nice. Now we have ourselves a fancy xml script to modify with help comments. Self-explanatory, right?</p>

<p>For those of you who can figure this out at first glance, I salute you.</p>

<p>The rest may read on.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>Ok. Let&rsquo;s break this down line by line.</p>

<p>Starting at line number one, we have our snippet bracket which contains the entirety of our code.</p>

<p>In the next line, the content bracket nested within the snippet bracket holds the block of code that we want to output when triggered. Within the block, ${1:this} and ${2:snippet} are used to point to where the cursor should be placed sequentially after each time the tab button is hit.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we have comments stating that we have the option to set the tabTrigger to trigger the snippet and also the option to indicate the format where the snippet is able to trigger.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing that anyone is free to not use the code that is commented out, but for the purposes of creating a fully functional snippet, the tabTrigger and scope elements are NOT optional. We want to specify how our snippet is triggered and where our triggers are able to function.</p>

<h2>Practice Mode</h2>

<p>As an example, we&rsquo;ll use one of the <a href="https://github.com/jamesmichiemo/CSS-sublimetext-snippets">Z-Snippets</a> that I created for CSS to compare with the &ldquo;New Snippet&hellip;&rdquo; template.</p>

<p>Text-Shadow snippet:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;snippet&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;content&gt;</span><span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[-webkit-text-shadow: ${1:}px ${2:} #${3:}; </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">-moz-text-shadow: ${1:}px ${2:} #${3:};</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">text-shadow: ${1:}px ${2:} #${3:};</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">]]&gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/content&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;tabTrigger&gt;</span>ztext-shadow<span class="nt">&lt;/tabTrigger&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;scope&gt;</span>text.html, source.css, source.less, source.scss, source.stylus<span class="nt">&lt;/scope&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/snippet&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the code that I replaced in the template.</p>

<p>First, I took out the <code>Hello, ${1:this} is a ${2:snippet}.</code> text within the content element and replaced it with the CSS code that I want to output if I trigger it. Note that the text must be placed within the <code>![CDATA[ ]]</code> brackets for the code to work properly. And for the sake of convenience, <code>${1:} ${2:}</code> and <code>${3:}</code> are used to type in the appropriate CSS values for multiple vendor prefixes simultaneously.</p>

<p>Next, I replaced the <code>hello</code> text with my own trigger text. Now with the text, <code>ztext-shadow</code>, placed within the tabTrigger element, the snippet will only trigger after pressing tab at the end of any ztext-shadow.</p>

<p>Lastly, we must identify which formats to allow the snippet to be used in. A CSS snippet would only be appropriate within file formats that are able to use CSS, such as HTML and LESS. Some snippets may clutter your autocomplete lists, if you&rsquo;re not careful enough to label your scope correctly. It&rsquo;s not a difficult task. I&rsquo;ve found that almost every format&rsquo;s scope is identified by typing &ldquo;source.&rdquo; before the file&rsquo;s extension, with the exception of HTML which uses text. as a prefix.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Play</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;re free to create a snippet of your own just like the one I made for myself.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made your own snippet script, you want to save your xml file over to the Sublime Text Package Folder. You can find where it is with Browse Packages under Preferences.</p>

<p>Snippets should start working immediately after saving. It&rsquo;s a simple code modification, but if it doesn&rsquo;t work out, you&rsquo;re probably better off learning <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/">Emmet coding</a> to start off with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be sure to expand on more coding techiniques in future posts as I learn more.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

			Studying With Anki Flashcards</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just the other week, I discovered an awesome flashcard app that helps with studying. The app is called <a href="http://ankisrs.net">Anki</a> and the best thing about it is that it&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform">cross-platform</a> compatible and <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>. It&rsquo;s a great app for retaining anything you have trouble remembering.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/R7kUt3T.png?1" alt="Anki Logo" /></p>

<p>Anki actually stands for &ldquo;memorizing&rdquo; in Japanese, and that is basically what this app specializes in assisting with. By using a <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> scheduling system for arranging the order of the flashcards, users are better able to focus their time more efficiently, balancing between the study time spent on learning new material and reviewing old material that&rsquo;s at risk of being forgotten.</p>

<p>This system is very similar to the popular <a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/The-Pimsleur-Method">Pimsluer method</a> used for language acquisition. It&rsquo;s a proven technique that&rsquo;s been used for several years.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already begun to use it to familiarize myself with what I&rsquo;m learning in the Physics class that I&rsquo;m taking right now. By the time each lecture is through, I have a full stack of flashcards ready to run through daily before my next exam.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a neat app but what blows my mind about Anki is the accessibility of the flashcards you create. Once you sign up for a free account with Anki, you&rsquo;ll have the ability to sync your flashcard collection with almost any computer device with an internet connection. This includes cell phones, Macs, Android devices, Windows and even Linux machines. There&rsquo;s even a client version for the Nintendo DS. It&rsquo;s the perfect anywhere anytime app.</p>

<p>In my opinion, there isn&rsquo;t a better productivity app out there for studying. Anki is free to download, except for the iPhone app which goes for $24.99. I bought the app full price and it was worth every penny. Try it out.</p>

			Dev Bootcamp</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ahhh! Right now I am super nervous about my <a href="http://Skype.com">Skype</a> interview with <a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> coming up in a few days. It&rsquo;s a bit intimidating considering their low acceptance rate for applicants.</p>

<p><img src="http://scm-l3.technorati.com/12/12/13/73853/devbootcamp.png?t=20121213131231" alt="Dev Bootcamp logo" /></p>

<p><a href="http://devbootcamp.com">Dev Bootcamp</a> is an intense 9 week training workshop located in San Francisco and Chicago. They take both beginner and experienced programmers, turning them into readily employable <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> beasts.</p>

<p>I first found out about DBC from reading a few discussions about the program on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/news">Hacker News</a> and I was impressed with what they had to offer in their curriculum. They cover mainly <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile</a> methodologies. It&rsquo;s very similar to what I&rsquo;m learning in <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu/degrees/campus/web-design-development-bachelors">Full Sail&rsquo;s web program</a> so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll be prepared once I start my training at DBC.</p>

<p>To handle my nerves, I&rsquo;ve been pushing myself much harder to learn how to become a Rails developer. My classes at Full Sail University have been a huge help so far and the tips that I&rsquo;ve gotten from meetups with <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a> and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> have been inspiring for me.</p>

<p>I know this career field is a good fit for me, but I still have my doubts about whether I&rsquo;ll be able to get into Dev Bootcamp. I&rsquo;m not the best student at school and I barely have enough experience with code to impress anyone familiar with dev subject matter. Right now, I&rsquo;m just relying on my passion to learn.</p>

<p>All I know for sure is that my path to becoming a Rails developer is going to be long and challenging, but I&rsquo;ll enjoy writing every step of the way.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>

			Using Octopress With Dropbox and Nocs</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Inspired by a tip from <a href="http://www.drastudio.com">Oscar Cortez</a>, one of my instructors at <a href="http://www.fullsail.edu">Full Sail University</a>, I decided to host my <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> locally on <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. I found this setup to be a great idea for editing on mobile devices, because with our repo connected to Dropbox, we are able to make changes to Octopress wherever Dropbox access is available.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tSVfJ6v.png?1" alt="Octopress in Dropbox" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually typing this blog post with a text editor on my iPhone. The app that I&rsquo;m using is called <a href="http://www.wisp.com/nocs/">Nocs</a>. It&rsquo;s a text editor that integrates well with both Dropbox and the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format that Octopress uses to publish with.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nooAe2Z.png?1" alt="Editting with Nocs" /></p>

<p>In the Nocs app, I&rsquo;m able to navigate and edit the Octopress directory through Dropbox with ease.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XV1xj25.png?1" alt="Navigating wit Nocs" /></p>

<p>The Dropbox/Nocs combo allows me to write anywhere with my iPhone. Then once my post is ready to go, all I need to do is push my Octopress repo up in <a href="" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)">Terminal</a> using</p>

<pre><code>$ rake generate</code></pre>


<p>and</p>

<pre><code>$ rake deploy</code></pre>


<p>Easy.</p>

<p>Both apps are available for free at the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/genre/ios/id36?mt=8">App Store</a>.</p>

			How to Make an Octopress: Setup</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The last time I tried to blog was ages ago in the early aughties when <a href="http://www.xanga.com">Xanga</a> ruled. Nowadays, <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> is definitely the most popular weapon of choice for blogging but I decided to go with Octopress to help expand my developer skills.</p>

<p><img src="http://drupal.org/files/project-images/octopress.png" alt="Octopress Logo" /></p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is basically a “blogging framework for hackers”. I like that it&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> and that <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> runs everything in the framework. All you need is your favorite text editor and some command line chops to start posting. Octopress sites are fast, secure, and mobile-friendly. The limitless amount of customization is also a huge bonus that I hope will keep me challenged and engaged in my coding.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in making your own Octopress, the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">official documentation</a> has a great guide to follow for setting up. It&rsquo;s a step by step walkthrough that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem for anyone comfortable with Terminal. For the sake of those that aren&rsquo;t satisfied with the Octopress docs, I&rsquo;ll share a simpler step by step guide that covers the initial setup.</p>

<h2>Preparations</h2>

<p>Before we begin installing Octopress, we must make sure that <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>, and Ruby 1.9.3 are up and running.</p>

<p>Open up Terminal and enter:</p>

<pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>


<p>then</p>

<pre><code>$ rvm --version</code></pre>


<p>and</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby --version</code></pre>


<p></p>

<p>The &mdash;version command will tell you which version of the application is currently installed. If no version is revealed, it must mean that your application is not installed.</p>

<p>If you need an easy guide for installing these tools, I recommend Moncef Belyamani&rsquo;s tutorial: <a href="http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/">How to Install Xcode, Homebrew, Git, RVM, &amp; Ruby 1.9.3 on Snow Leopard &amp; Lion.</a></p>

<h2>Installing Octopress</h2>

<p>Go to the directory where you would like to use Octopress and clone the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress">original repo</a> by inputing the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress </code></pre>


<h2>Setting up Octopress</h2>

<p>Once installed, enter the Octopress folder just cloned.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd octopress</code></pre>


<p></p>

<p>If RVM is installed, you&rsquo;ll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file, type yes.</p>

<h2>Installing Dependencies</h2>

<p>Inside the Octopress folder, the following commands must be entered for the <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler gem</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install bundler</code></pre>




<pre><code>$ bundle install</code></pre>


<h2>Installing the Default Octopress Theme</h2>

<p>Finally, to add some styling, enter:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake install</code></pre>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>At this point, we have everything we need to make a blog post, but we still need to deploy our octopress to a host and also make changes the blog configurations to make the site more personalized.  I&rsquo;ll be sure to cover those steps in a future post. I hope this post helps out anyone with an interest in making a new Octopress.</p>
