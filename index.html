			Vim Adventures: Video Game Review</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="images/vimadventures.jpg" alt="The title screen for Vim Adventures" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a> is my absolute favorite text editor. I recommend it to anyone who loves using Unix tools. It&rsquo;s a powerful weapon for editing scripts but it isn&rsquo;t for everyone. The main issue that most people have with Vim is that it has a steep learning curve. Performing even a small task like typing a single character is nearly impossible for a beginner to figure out. It&rsquo;s a tool that forces the user to read the manual.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely no substitute for reading through Vim&rsquo;s documentation and built-in tutorial but for those that love RPG styled video games, Vim Adventures is an excellent alternative.</p>

<p><a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">Vim Adventures</a> is an in-browser puzzle game that plays a lot like a tile based RPG. In the game you play as the &ldquo;shadowy cursor&rdquo; prophecized to save the world from doom. This should sound very familiar if you&rsquo;ve played a few video games with RPG elements but this time your skills aren&rsquo;t gained through experience points from battle. As the game progresses, your character collects shortcut keys obtained through solving puzzles. Every puzzle challenges the player to learn how to use Vim in the most effecient manner possible.</p>

<p>The challenges are tough and you&rsquo;ll soon find yourself <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+do+you+pass+level+3+in+Vim+Adventures%3F">Googling</a> for help along the way. I advice against spoiling the game like that. If you truly want to learn Vim, try to stick it out without looking up the solutions. At least make sure to talk to all the NPCs first if you find yourself stuck. Don&rsquo;t give up. The challenges are designed to illustrate both the capablities and limitations of each shortcut command through every attempt made to solve the puzzle. You might spend hours on a single puzzle but by the time you&rsquo;re through with it, you&rsquo;ll be satisfied knowing that you&rsquo;ve learned a new trick that can be brought into your text editing workflow.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve gotten up to Level 7 and at this point I feel extremely comfortable maneuvering with Vim. Playing the game really helps to build the necessary muscle memory needed to work without having to looking up the shortcuts for every command. I&rsquo;m sure by the end of the game I&rsquo;ll have true mastery over Vim but for now I&rsquo;ll keep my Vim cheat sheet close by.</p>

<p>Vim Adventures is free to try out but expect to pay at least 25 dollars for the full game. For the price, the game is totally worth it. Very few video games teach anything at all, let alone something as difficult as Vim. Don&rsquo;t miss out.</p>

			Fatal Conflict: Git vs Dropbox</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So this morning, I ran into a very small problem that had to do with version control. I decided to update a repo that I had been working on for the past few days on another laptop. When I attempted to perform a git pull, I was given an error message that said, &ldquo;fatal: Reference has invalid format: &lsquo;refs/heads/master&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After doing a bit of research I discovered that the problem may have been caused by using both Git and Dropbox at the same time for the same project. Now I&rsquo;ve actually been warned NOT to do this, but I&rsquo;m stubborn about my tools and I figured that if it&rsquo;s been working for me for months, there really shouldn&rsquo;t be any reason why I should do away with my own methods for my own projects.</p>

<p>I could do away with using Dropbox for coding, but Dropbox is super convenient for accessing projects on mobile phones. Github recently made a super slick mobile web version of their website for accessing repos on smartphones, but it&rsquo;s not really made for editing. You can look but you can&rsquo;t touch.</p>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m refactoring code on my phone on the regular, but it&rsquo;s still a nice feature to have, just in case. Until I figure out how to use bash on the phone, I&rsquo;ll stick to Dropbox.</p>

<p>Anyways, the conflict wasn&rsquo;t too hard to fix. The problem was that Dropbox made an extra copy of a file that I already have. To fix the error I had to run a command that would look for the conflicted copy and destroy it. For this I used this command in the repo:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ find . -type f -name "* conflicted copy*" -exec rm -f {} \; </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>With that command, I was able to get rid of the error and resume using git as usual. Simple right?</p>

<p>This was probably the proof that I needed that Git and Dropbox don&rsquo;t mix well together, but I&rsquo;ll probably still use Dropbox and Git anyway. What else could go wrong?</p>

			War on Privacy</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Nowadays, information rules the world. Personal data has become THE commodity for many of the enterprises we rely on everyday on the web, and our privacy is rarely ever considered when such data is exchanged. How do we even let such things happen in a world where identity is so important? For that matter, why should we even care what happens to our personal data?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.conservativedailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/cispa-passes-house.jpg" alt="CISPA" /></p>

<p>You should care because it&rsquo;s your info. It&rsquo;s not okay for agencies to pass along your private information without consent. I&rsquo;m sure many of you are aware that CISPA needs to be stopped but this privacy war will not end with this bill.</p>

<p>Sure, go ahead and blackout or whatever. Spread awareness. Let everyone know that their privacy is at risk of being abused.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re done. Take action. Direct action. I recommend that everyone take their privacy into their own hands and familiarize themselves with basic cryptography.</p>

			Introducing Solavei</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://www.funinoklahoma.com/1-%20Global/Solavei/Pics,%20Logos,%20Flyers/Solavei_Logo_4c_notag_600.png" alt="Solavei" /></p>

<p>A few months ago, I learned about a new mobile service called <a href="http://www.solavei.com/omeichim">Solavei</a>. Back then I was looking around for a reasonable unlimited phone plan that didn&rsquo;t involve contracts. At the time, my phone carrier was <a href="http://goredpocket.com">Red Pocket Mobile</a>, which was great but their mobile web data plan costed more and was limited to only 2gigs of data and I wasn&rsquo;t going to sign a contract with another mobile service to be charged for more data usage.</p>

<p>Personally, I can&rsquo;t stand contract service agreements. If I&rsquo;m unhappy with anyone&rsquo;s service, I should be able to decide not to continue doing business with them. Why should I guarantee my money every month to a phone service that&rsquo;s questionable? I&rsquo;ve always felt more comfortable using a prepaid plan. I like the freedom of having other options available.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='an affordable unlimited mobile service plan without any contract agreements'>
But you know what? Companies probably make you sign contracts so you won&rsquo;t run off to new companies like <a href="http://www.solavei.com/omeichim">Solavei</a>. I lucked out finding a great service like Solavei. I found an affordable unlimited mobile service plan without any contract agreements and so far I&rsquo;m really happy with it.
</span></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t really trust them at first since they&rsquo;re a completely new company, but my family in Dallas who I love and trust assured me that Solavei was something that I would want to be a part of.</p>

<p>After hours of research, I went ahead and ditched my old plan and ordered my unlimited phone plan with <a href="http://www.solavei.com/omeichim">Solavei</a>. It&rsquo;s been 3 months already and I&rsquo;m 100% satisfied with their revolutionary phone service.</p>

<p>My prepaid plan came up to $58.34 a month including tax and that&rsquo;s without participating in their <a href="http://www.solavei.com/what-is-solavei">referral program</a>. If you recruit enough members to Solavei, eventually, you won&rsquo;t even have a monthly bill to pay. Solavei actually pays its members for sharing their services with other people.</p>

<p>Switching carriers was a no brainer for me. There were no activation fees involved other than the 9 dollar SIM card I had to ship to myself. Once I got my SIM card in the mail, I popped it into my iPhone and I was set. I&rsquo;ve never been happier with my phone.</p>

<p>It feels awesome to be able to blog about this new service as an early adopter. I have a feeling that Solavei is only going to get bigger. Be sure to check out Solavie&rsquo;s video down below to learn more.</p>

			Post-Startupbus</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><a href="http://americas.startupbus.com/">&ldquo;5 days. 6 buses. 30 startups.
On March 3rd, 152 people set out from 6 cities to build a startup on a bus&hellip;and launch it 1800 miles later in Austin Texas&rdquo;</a></p>

<p><img src="http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2013/03/IMG_1203.jpg" alt="startup bus" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny how my very first hackathon experience ended up being one of the largest hackathon events in the nation. Last week, I took a chance and signed up for <a href="http://startupbus.com/">Startupbus America</a>. It was fun but I must must warn everyone that it isn&rsquo;t for the faint of heart.</p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>The first day, I met up with the SouthEast StartupBus crew in Tampa. Once the bus started moving, we all shared our startup business ideas and split up into teams. After all the startup pitches, I joined up with Adam Nerland, Anthony Decana, and Ashley Mooney to create <a href="http://thumbtrotter.com">Thumbtrotter</a>. We all liked Adam&rsquo;s idea to create a ridesharing mobile app with &ldquo;Couchsurfing&rdquo; elements. Within minutes, Ashley quickly drew up a window mural of all our brainstorming ideas and at that point, we were ready to hack.</p>

<p><img src="https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/482282_426268240790657_2067027034_n.png" alt="thumbtrotter" /></p>

<p>We were ready to hack, but we also needed power and internet to do our work. The bus had to go pick up a generator for our laptops, so we stopped by <a href="http://www.coworkjax.com">CoworkJax</a> to get started and get ourselves situated. It was a short stop, but it was enough for us to have a steady internet connection and a place to sit and work. Thank you CoworkJax.</p>

<p><img src="http://b.vimeocdn.com/ps/273/664/2736649_300.jpg" alt="coworkjax" /></p>

<p>For internet on the road, I had to rely on phone tethering. It wasn&rsquo;t the best but it was all we had. I don&rsquo;t really recommend mobile internet use in transit. Connections dropped in and out throughout the entire trip. It was awful.</p>

<p>Our bus ride was basically an internet-less desert, and I continued to share sips of <a href="solavei.com/omeichim">unlimited mobile internet</a> with iPhone tethering. It was enough to get us through until Atlanta.</p>

<p>In Atlanta, we stopped at our second co-working space, <a href="http://www.hypepotamus.com">Hypepotamus</a>. Landing here was like finding an oasis. We were greeted by Georgia Tech students over there and got to see some of their own startup ideas. It was an awesome welcome into the startup world in Atlanta. Anyone in the area looking for tech hot spots in Atlanta should start looking here.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.hypepotamus.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hypepotamus-bw-192x230.png" alt="hypepotamus" /></p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>On our second day, we had breakfast at the <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a> office. The tour was great. We had a chance to take a look inside the office of a successful startup brand. The place looked like a fun and creative office space. It had a very strong personality. Geek paraphanelia was littered all over, and I thought about stealing all of their framed <a href="http://www.streetfighter.com/sf3s/">Street Fighter 3</a> portraits off the wall.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/X2VFvt2.jpg?1" alt="monkey business" /></p>

<p>The geek stuff was all in good taste though. It never felt too overwhelming like entering <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090500/">Pee Wee&rsquo;s Playhouse</a>. You could just feel that the work culture there would make any kind of geek comfortable.</p>

<p>By the end of the tour, we all had swag bags full of cool monkey themed merchandise. The whole insider&rsquo;s startup experience was fun. Mailchimp is definitely on my list of places to apply to once I graduate.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wmLxMpw.jpg?1" alt="mailchimp swag" /></p>

<p>Thanks for all the swag gear.</p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>On the third day, we made our way to NOLA, better known as New Orleans, LA. Here was where we met up with StartupBus Midwest. <a href="http://lp.co/">Launchpad</a> gave us a warm welcome when we arrived and there at their co-work space, we shared our startups with each other and also got a feel for the budding tech scene in New Orleans.</p>

<p><img src="http://lp.co/images/logo.png" alt="launch pad" /></p>

<p>By this time, our team already established our game plan for Thumbtrotter. While our Thumbtrotter app was still in its early development stages, we were still able to gain a good amount of Facebook likes for our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Thumbtrotter">Facebook page</a>. We did a bit of our work in NOLA, but most of our time there was spent getting to know each other.</p>

<p>It was great meeting other devs who were crazy enough to work on a bus for 5 days straight. I learned a lot talking with everyone and I was able to get a feel for the <a href="http://overapi.com/">languages and tools</a> that I would need to learn to be competitive in this career field. I loved how the devs I met were just as eager to teach as much I was eager to learn, and everyone seemed to share a common respect for each other for the work that they did.</p>

<p>It was here that I realized how fast dev communities are growing everywhere. I met some really smart people from the Midwest, and all through the entire trip we&rsquo;ve been finding cool tech spots in cities like Tampa, New Orleans, Jacksonville, and Atlanta. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought the tech community only revolved around places like Silicon Valley. The reality is that you find these awesome communities by doing the things you love rather than where you go.</p>

<p>I love &lsquo;Aha&rsquo; moments.</p>

<h2>Days 4 and 5</h2>

<p>Our final days were spent in San Antonio, Texas. All 6 buses from all over North America finally made it to the main event hosted at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4b0UlAZcH4">&ldquo;Rackspace Castle&rdquo;</a>. This was the battleground for our startups to compete amongst each other.</p>

<p><img src="http://c15162226.r26.cf2.rackcdn.com/Rackspace_Cloud_Company_Logo_clr_300x109.jpg" alt="rackspace" /></p>

<p>All together, there were around 150 of us packed into Rackspace Headquarters and every team gave it their all to be the champion startup.</p>

<p>When it came time to introduce our startup to the judges, we gave them our pitch video.</p>

    <iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hnnKjm7b03Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>      
</div>


<p>My team was ready to win, but we were challenged with the fact that there were other existing ridesharing apps for mobile. The judges were not impressed even though we had a working prototype ready and a viable business plan that seperated us from rival competitors.</p>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>Team Thumbtrotter didn&rsquo;t win, but we weren&rsquo;t defeated. We came together to create an awesome app that we believed in and shared it with everyone we knew. StartupBus was only the beginning for us and we understood that more opportunities would present themselves in the future for our startup ventures to grow.</p>

			How to Use Octopress: Deployment</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In our last <a href="http://jamesmichiemo.github.com/blog/2013/02/16/installing-octopress/">&ldquo;How to Use Octopress&rdquo;</a> blog post, we went over how to setup our blog, but that was only the first step. The next step would be to make our Octopress available through hosting. Right now, the Octopress we installed is only setup locally. Only users with access to your computer are able to view the blog, but once we have our Octopress available through hosting, anyone with internet access will be able to find it.</p>

<p>For hosting my own blog, I chose to use <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>. There were several other options but I felt better having my blog linked to the same place I keep my other projects on <a href="https://github.com/jamesmichiemo">my Github account</a>. It made sense considering that most of what I&rsquo;ll be writing about on my blog will revolve around these repositories. As I update my repos, I&rsquo;ll be updating my blog.</p>

<p><img src="http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/octocat1.png" alt="Octocat" /></p>

<h2>Using Github Pages</h2>

<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> is a free public hosting service that allows users more freedom in workflow options with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> and other tools for web such as <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It&rsquo;s most likely the best choice for our blog. I assume Octopress was created with Github in mind, considering the workflow format and the similarity between mascots.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty documentation for assisting in deploying to Github Pages on the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/">official docs page</a>. I recommend following the simple instructions offered there, but I&rsquo;ll still walkthrough and share my experience deploying my Octopress.</p>

<h3>Creating a New Github Repository</h3>

<p>For a Github Page, we will need a Github account. <a href="https://github.com/users">Make one</a> if you don&rsquo;t have a Github account already.</p>

<p>With your Github account, <a href="https://github.com/new">create a new repository</a> and name the repo <code>username.github.com</code></p>

<p><code><a href="http://username.github.com">http://username.github.com</a></code> will be the url for the Octopress.</p>

<h3>Configuring Github Pages</h3>

<p>The next step in our deployment is to use <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> to configure github pages. Octopress has a built-in task for setting up everything so all that&rsquo;s needed is the following command to be entered into Terminal while inside the Octopress directory.</p>

<pre><code>rake setup_github_pages</code></pre>


<p>A prompt will appear to enter the repo url. Entering the url made in the previous step will link your Octopress to the new Github repo.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s complete, we are now able to use rake to commit and push whatever changes that are made to the Octopress directory by entering:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate</code>
<code>rake deploy</code></pre>


<p>With this our Octopress is now published!</p>

<p>Check the url to see if it&rsquo;s up. If you can&rsquo;t find your blog at the url, carefully repeat the steps until it works.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve only covered the beginning stages, but at least now we have a visible working blog on the web. Next, we&rsquo;ll take a look into posting and making configurations with Octopress.</p>

			StartupBus 2013</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is gonna be so awesome! Yesterday, I got the news that I&rsquo;ve been accepted to join the <a href="http://startupbus.com/">StartupBus</a> crew for 2013. Once again, I&rsquo;ll be making my pilgrimage over to Austin for <a href="http://sxsw.com/">SxSW</a>. This&rsquo;ll be my 4th trip to the conference, but this time I&rsquo;ll be joining a team to create a startup on our way there.</p>

<p><img src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2013-02-19/AdxnhkBpnliGDiEJotxhumEodpcFovhuJbaAmwklArkmCzkHyAbCIqoxzDcm/The_Bus.jpg.scaled500.jpg" alt="StartupBus" /></p>

<p>The StartupBus is basically an annual event where teams of strangers on a bus travel together to conceive, build and launch startups. Each team only has 72 hours to create a startup that&rsquo;s ready to present to potential investors at the end of the trip.</p>

<p>Right now I&rsquo;m really psyched to be a part of this and I&rsquo;m very thankful for this opportunity to collaborate with others to do great things.</p>

			Dev Bootcamp: Post-Interview</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>The Decision</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s disappointing, but the folks at Dev Bootcamp decided that I was not a good fit for the program. I&rsquo;m not completely surprised considering what I had learned of their expectations after the 9 weeks of training.</p>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qp-iEkmZat4/T86GsKnKOmI/AAAAAAAAASE/zynlHGxrjTk/s1600/rejected.gif" alt="Rejected" /></p>

<p>A good chunk of my interview with Karim Bishay was spent discussing what was to be expected after Dev Bootcamp. After thorough questioning, it became clear to me that Dev Bootcamp was more than a 9 week commitment. Boots are expected to hit the ground running into their careers.</p>

<p>My plans were a bit different, since my goals at Dev Bootcamp had more to do with supplementing the education and training that I already had in place for myself. Moving and working in San Francisco would have been a dream come true but I wasn&rsquo;t willing to make that decision right now as a commited student at Full Sail University.</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to speculate the reasons for why things happen, but I don&rsquo;t want to fall into the trap of dwelling on my failed interview. Right now, the best thing for me to do is to focus on improving my interviewing skills. Apparently, I don&rsquo;t interview well, so I should be working on that right away. To prepare for future interviews, I&rsquo;ll be focusing on practicing the main thing I believe that&rsquo;s important to master for scoring developer positions, solving puzzles.</p>

<h3>Puzzles</h3>

<p>As a developer, you&rsquo;ll be expected to solve several problems in your career. By sharing the way you solve problems through interview puzzles, employers are better able to gauge your critical thinking ablities. It isn&rsquo;t enough that you get the right answer. What matters is your ability to communicate what you&rsquo;re doing to solve the problem and why you&rsquo;re doing it. The only way to get better at this is to practice.</p>

<p><img src="http://projecteuler.net/images/euler_portrait.png" alt="A Portrait of Euler" /></p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a great site for sharpening your problem solving skills. Taking the time to work through these puzzles will help tremendously for developer interviews. I&rsquo;ve already created an account for myself, so by the time I get to my next interview, I&rsquo;ll be ready for anything.</p>

<h2>What I&rsquo;ve Learned</h2>

<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned is that this isn&rsquo;t going to be an easy career field to get into. It&rsquo;s going to take a lot of work. I&rsquo;m going to have to rely on dedication and perserverance to get what I want out of this.  There&rsquo;ll be plenty of fail along the way, but it&rsquo;s okay because there&rsquo;s more to learn from our failures than from our small successes along the way.</p>

			The Cathode App for Mac</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For those of you who like to get your hands dirty in the shell, I want to show you a really cool Mac app that&rsquo;s made by <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/">Secret Geometry</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.secretgeometry.com/media/screenshot13.jpg" alt="Cathode screens" /></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.secretgeometry.com/apps/cathode/">Cathode</a> app is an emulator that runs Terminal in a retro style that closely resembles cathode monitors from the past. It&rsquo;s a fun Terminal alternative for anyone who likes to apply unique themes to their favorite apps. All of the themes that come with Cathode are incredibly detailed and take their authentic looking styles from several different computer eras.</p>

<p>The older crowd will definitely appreciate the app for all the flicker and noise effects that give a nostalgic feel to the Terminal experience. For others, it&rsquo;s a nice to have novelty app that looks like an old school tool for hacking.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s a wonderful app that&rsquo;s stable, reliable, and fun to use. I like to have it open at all times in case I need to use the command line for anything.</p>

<p>Cathode is free to evaluate but it&rsquo;s $9.99 for the full version. Go ahead and give it a try.</p>
