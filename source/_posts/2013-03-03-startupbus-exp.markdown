Startupbus 2013 is finally underway. I'm really lucky to be here on such an awesome trip with such amazing people. I haven't had a lot of sleep in the past few days of work but I'm pumped from all the energy that everyone has. It's only just begun and I feel enough inspiration to take on anything.

So far our working conditions have been awful due to lack of any internet connection on the bus. I thought we'd be covered with phone tethering, but it's been fail since go. We've had to rely on our wits to face up to the challenge of building a working business to present in 3 days. It's been a fish out of water experience to say the least. 

I can't complain though. I was looking for this kind of challenge and with everything that's come up, I have not been disappointed. 

I'll update this blog when it's over. There really isn't much time for writing, so I'll leave all the good stuff for the weekend.
