This is gonna be so awesome! Yesterday, I got the news that I've been accepted to join the [StartupBus](http://startupbus.com/) crew for 2013. Once again, I'll be making my pilgrimage over to Austin for [SxSW](http://sxsw.com/). This'll be my 4th trip to the conference, but this time I'll be joining a team to create a startup on our way there.

The StartupBus is basically an annual event where teams of strangers on a bus travel together to conceive, build and launch startups. Each team only has 72 hours to create a startup that's ready to present to potential investors at the end of the trip. 

Right now I'm really psyched to be a part of this and I'm very thankful for this opportunity to collaborate with others to do great things.
