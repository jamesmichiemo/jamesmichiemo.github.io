My Macbook is dead. I knew this would happen one day, especially at an important time, like now, when I'm preparing for an internship interview for Linkedin. It's entirely my fault. I shouldn't have been drinking and typing. It was a sad moment to watch the water from my cup flow right through my keyboard buttons, but it wasn't as painful as it could have been.

Right now, I'm looking into getting my Macbook replaced but in the meantime I have work to do. Luckily, I've got another machine at home running Ubuntu. Right before my disaster, I was able to upload my dotfile configurations to Github, so I'm fortunate enough to be able to transfer my previous development environment over to my Ubuntu laptop. It's an old and clunky laptop compared to my Macbook but it works almost completely the same as far as Unix tools. 

I also dodged a bullet by keeping all my current projects on Dropbox. I'd have to say that Dropbox probably uses up the most processing power out of all the applications on my machine right now but it's worth it having all your important documents synced just in case anything happens. Backing up files is never a bad idea.

I should be more upset about my situation but everything happens for a reason. I'll just remember this as a learning experience and a lesson in how you can never be too prepared for when disaster strikes. 

Back up everything.
