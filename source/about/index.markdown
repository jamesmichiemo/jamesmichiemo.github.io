Welcome to my personal blog.

Occassionally, I'll write here about interesting things that are related to tech culture and programming.

Currently, I'm staying in Orlando and studying at Full Sail University. Most of my days are spent learning how to become a better web developer, either through school work or side projects. 

The random things I end up working on are usually posted on [my Github account](http://github.com/jamesmichiemo), including this blog built with Octopress.

Feel free to reach me at anytime.
